    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        I am an AI Researcher currently working as a Technical Lead at HCLTech Engineering and R&D Services (ERS), 
        AITech, where I focus on implementing AI-based solutions for speech processing tasks. 
        I hold a master’s degree in Electrical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Dharwad (IIT-Dh). 
        My thesis involved detecting depression 
        from speech signals using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques.
